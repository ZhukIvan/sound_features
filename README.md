# Neuron spikes based sound feature extraction
-----------
The research based on simulation of neuron spikes in auditory nerve triggered by sound and afterwards classification with simple convolution net.

to do:
add more complicated models (resnet, inception)
compare directly with different spectrograms(linear, log, cochleagram)
